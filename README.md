## ‚ùì What is Autodesk Revit?

Autodesk Revit is a Building Information Modeling (BIM) environment developed for architects, engineers, and construction professionals. It allows you to design and document structures and systems with intelligent 3D objects and coordinated views.

Revit supports architectural modeling, structural engineering, MEP systems, and construction planning within a unified workspace. Users can create parametric families, manage documentation automatically, and coordinate disciplines in real-time.

Compatible with various rendering and coordination tools, Revit offers seamless design-to-delivery workflows across small and large-scale projects. Its intuitive environment and data-driven structure make it a core tool in modern architecture and engineering workflows.
